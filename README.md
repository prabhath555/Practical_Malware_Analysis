# Practical Malware Analysis

Welcome to the repository for completing Practical Malware Analysis. This project involves conducting malware analysis on FlareVM and REMnux (vulnerable Windows machines) and compiling a detailed report on the findings.

## Project Objectives

1. **Malware Analysis**: Conduct comprehensive malware analysis using both static and dynamic analysis techniques.
2. **Reporting**: Compile and submit a detailed report on the findings, including analysis techniques, observations, and recommendations.

## Project Structure

- `malware-analysis/`: Contains scripts, tools, and documentation related to the malware analysis process.
- `reports/`: Contains the detailed malware analysis report.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Set up Analysis Environments**:
    - **FlareVM**: Install FlareVM on a Windows virtual machine for a comprehensive suite of reverse engineering and malware analysis tools.
    - **REMnux**: Set up REMnux, a Linux distribution designed for reverse engineering and analyzing malware.

2. **Prepare Malware Samples**:
    - Collect and isolate malware samples for analysis.
    - Ensure samples are handled in a controlled and secure environment to prevent accidental infection.

## Malware Analysis Process

### 1. Static Analysis
- **Objective**: Examine the malware without executing it to gather information about its structure, functionality, and potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- **Tools Used**: Strings, PEiD, Dependency Walker, IDA Pro, Binary Ninja.
- **Steps**:
  1. Inspect the file headers and metadata.
  2. Analyze the strings within the malware.
  3. Examine the import/export table.
  4. Use disassembly tools to analyze the code structure.

### 2. Dynamic Analysis
- **Objective**: Execute the malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior and identify any actions it performs.
- **Tools Used**: Process Monitor, Process Explorer, Wireshark, Regshot, OllyDbg.
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up a safe and isolated environment (e.g., virtual machine with snapshots).
  2. Monitor file system changes, registry modifications, and network activity.
  3. Use debugging tools to step through the execution of the malware.
  4. Capture and analyze network traffic generated by the malware.

## Reporting

1. **Create the Report**:
    - Document each phase of the malware analysis process.
    - Include details of the static and dynamic analysis techniques used.
    - Provide comprehensive observations, including indicators of compromise (IOCs) and potential impacts.
    - Offer recommendations for detection, prevention, and mitigation.

2. **Submit the Report**:
    - Save the report in the `reports/` directory as `Malware_Analysis_Report.md` or `Malware_Analysis_Report.pdf`.
    - Ensure the report is thorough and easy to understand.

## Example Tools

- **Static Analysis**: Strings, PEiD, Dependency Walker, IDA Pro, Binary Ninja.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Process Monitor, Process Explorer, Wireshark, Regshot, OllyDbg.
